Before doing the real editing, you first cut out the "dead space" which is typically silence. This is known as a "first pass". Cutting these is a boring task, especially if the video is very long.

```
auto-editor path/to/your/video.mp4
```

<h2 align="center">Installing</h2>

```
pip install auto-editor
```

See [Installing](https://github.com/WyattBlue/auto-editor/blob/master/articles/installing.md) for additional information.


<h2 align="center">Cutting</h2>

Change the **pace** of the edited video by using `--frame-margin`.

`--frame-margin` will including small sections that are next to loud parts. A frame margin of 8 will add up to 8 frames before and 8 frames after the loud part.

```
auto-editor example.mp4 --frame-margin 8
```

<h3>Set how cuts are made</h3>

Use the `--edit` option. to change how auto-editor makes automated cuts.

For example, edit out motionlessness in a video by setting `--edit motion`.


```
# cut out sections where percentage of motion is less than 2.
auto-editor example.mp4 --edit motion --motion-threshold 2%

# --edit is set to "audio" by default
auto-editor example.mp4 --silent-threshold 4%

# audio and motion thresholds are toggled independently
auto-editor example.mp4 --edit motion:threshold=10%,blur=10_or_audio:threshold=30%
```

<h2 align="center">Exporting to Editors</h2>

Create an XML file that can be imported to Adobe Premiere Pro using this command:

```
auto-editor example.mp4 --export premiere
```

Similar commands exist for:

- `--export final-cut-pro` for Final Cut Pro.
- `--export shotcut` for ShotCut.

Other editors, like Sony Vegas, can understand the `premiere` format. If your favorite editor doesn't, you can use ` --export clip-sequence` which creates many video clips that can be imported and manipulated like normal.

<h2 align="center">Manual Editing</h2>

Use the `--cut-out` option to always remove a section.

```
# Cut out the first 10 seconds.
auto-editor example.mp4 --cut-out start,10sec

# Cut out the first 10 frames.
auto-editor example.mp4 --cut-out start,10

# Cut out the last 10 seconds.
auto-editor example.mp4 --cut-out -10sec,end

# Cut out the first 10 seconds and cut out the range from 15 seconds to 20 seconds.
auto-editor example.mp4 --cut-out start,10sec 15sec,20sec
```

And of course, all the audio cuts still apply.

If you don't want **any automatic cuts**, use `--edit none`

```
# Cut out the first 5 seconds, leave the rest untouched.
auto-editor example.mp4 --edit none --cut-out start,5sec
```

And the inverse

```
# Leave in the first 5 seconds, cut everything else out.
auto-editor example.mp4 --edit all --add-in start,5sec
```

<h2 align="center">More Options</h2>

List all available options:

```
auto-editor --help
```

Use `--help` with a specific option for more information:

```
auto-editor --scale --help
  --scale
    Scale the output media file by a certain factor.

    type: float_type
    default: 1
```
